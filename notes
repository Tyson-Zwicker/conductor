Kinds of game objects:

1. Game Entity:
  - exists in game coordinates which can change
  - can rotate
  - has own velocity and spin (is Mover)
  - on screen position affected by the camera position and zoom levels.
  - can interact with mouse
  - can contain subparts
  - can have text label (with offset, affected by zoom level)
  - must have concept of toggle and radio

2. Particle:
  - has own velocity (is Mover)
  - exists in game coordinates which change
  - position can change with camera and zoom levels
  - do not interact with mouse.
  - do not have label

3. Button:
  - fixed on screen position (no game coordinates) (is NOT mover)*
  - bounds do not need to be recalculated.
  - can interact with mouse
  - can have text label (fixed offset - centered in bounds)
  - must have concept toggle and radio

Commonality:

  - they all need to have bounds in order to work with the mouse
  - they all need to have a sprite to represent them
  - most need a click event
  - most need a hover and press alternate sprite
  - most need a toggle setting.
  - most need a text label
  - buttons need a "fixed screen" coordinate.

TASKS:
  * +allow for unfilled sprite
  * +attach text (with offset)
  * +add camera translation 
  * +add camera zoom functionality to draw..
  * +add fixed screen coords (for buttons)
  * +add mouse-wheel event, provide an option for the user to enable it, and have it change the camera zoom level 
    automatically.
  * add velocity and spin
  * add parts.
  * implement a color system (for particle fade)
  * add particles
  * add a function that will add a user-defined function to be called when the canvas is clicked, but no game object was
    the recipient of the click (the mouse clicked nothing)
