I'm using all the stuff from the other repo called "Engine", this time I'm trying to use closures to make it look cleaner, at least from the outside.

Just Now:  Dropped 200 lines or so of "}" and un-indented everything a lot, by throwing the errors at the top of the functions.

Current Issue: Part rotation is not rotating..
Next : Color managment (component<->CSS strng, lerping, etc.)
Then: Particles: game objects that fade away..
