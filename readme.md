I'm using all the stuff from the other repo called "Engine", this time I'm trying to use closures to make it look cleaner, at least from the outside.

Currently: almost done adding "parts" to game objects.
Next: Physics.
Then: Refactor this thing!!  I need to take the inner closures and put them somewhere else.  Working with a >1000 line closure is giving me "scroll finger"-itis.
